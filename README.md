# cybereagle2001 wordlist

When it comes to password cracking. The Tunisian pentesters are suffering because of the natural language of our country. That's why I decided to create this project where you will find the tunisian possible passswords.

### cybereagle2001_wordlist
In this wordlist I am trying to gather all possible passwords that the tunisians can use.

### cybereagle2001_airboxpass.list.7z 

This is a special wordlist created for Airbox. The majority of people are not changing the default passwords. So using this wordlist you can crack all the airobox passwords with a rate of success equal to 90%.
